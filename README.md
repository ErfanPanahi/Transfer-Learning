# Transfer-Learning
In this repository, I intend to implement the idea of Transfer Learning for the EfficientNetB0 network. To achieve this, based on the selected dataset (images of cats and dogs), I will modify the last layer of the EfficientNetB0 network in a way that the network's output will only be the label of either "cat" or "dog."
